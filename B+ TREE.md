# Experiment 10(d): B+ Tree

## Aim
To write a Python function `def insert(self, k)` to insert nodes in a B+ Tree.

---

## Algorithm

1. Define the `Node` class to represent a node in the B+ Tree with keys, values, and methods for adding keys, splitting the node, checking if it's full, and showing its contents.
2. Define the `BPlusTree` class to represent the entire B+ Tree with methods to find, insert, retrieve, and merge nodes, and display the tree.
3. In the `insert()` method, insert a key-value pair into the tree, and split nodes if necessary while merging them when they become full.
4. In the `retrieve()` method, search for a key in the tree and return its associated values.
5. Call `demo_node()` and `demo_bplustree()` to demonstrate the creation, insertion, and splitting of nodes in the tree and show the structure of the B+ Tree.
