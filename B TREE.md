# Experiment 10(c): B Tree

## Aim
To write a Python function `def insert(self, k)` to insert nodes in a B Tree.

---

## Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. Define the `BTreeNode` class to represent a node with keys, children, and a leaf status.
3. Define the `BTree` class with methods to insert keys, handle node splits, and print the tree.
4. Implement the `insert()` method to insert a key into the tree, handling splits if necessary.
5. Implement the `insert_non_full()` method to insert a key into a node that is not full.
6. Implement the `split_child()` method to split a child node when itâ€™s full.
7. Implement `print_tree()` to display the tree structure.
8. Run the program to insert keys and display the tree.
9. End the program.
